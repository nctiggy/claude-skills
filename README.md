## Skill Structure

    ├── SKILL.md           # Required - main skill definition
    ├── scripts/           # Optional - automation scripts
    ├── references/        # Optional - additional documentation

### SKILL.md Requirements

```yaml

name: kebab-case-name      # Required, max 64 chars

### Design Principles

From Anthropic's skill-creator guidance:

1. **Concise is key** - Claude is already smart, only add context it doesn't have
2. **Progressive disclosure** - Metadata (~100 words) always loaded, SKILL.md body (<5k words) when triggered, bundled resources as needed
3. **Set appropriate degrees of freedom** - Match specificity to task fragility
4. **Size limits** - SKILL.md should stay under 500 lines; split into `references/` when approaching this limit

## Local Development

### Testing with Claude Code

Symlink your skills to Claude Code's skills directory:

```bash
# Global (all Claude Code sessions)
make sync

# Project-specific (current directory only)
make sync-project
```

After syncing, your skills will be available in Claude Code. Edit the source files and re-run Claude Code to test changes.

### Validation

```bash
# Validate all skills
make validate

# Validate specific skill
make validate SKILL=my-skill-name
```

Validation checks:
- YAML frontmatter exists and is valid
- `name` is kebab-case, max 64 characters
- `description` is present, max 1024 characters, no angle brackets
- SKILL.md is under 500 lines
- Body content is under 5000 words

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Pull Requests

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on PRs that modify `skills/**`:
- Validates all changed skills
- Fails PR if validation errors found

### Deployment

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` runs on push to `main` when `skills/**` changes:
- Detects which skills changed
- Validates each changed skill
- Packages each to `.skill` file
- Uploads to Anthropic API
- Stores packaged skills as artifacts

Manual deployment via workflow dispatch:
- Deploy specific skill by name
- Deploy all skills at once

### Releases

When you create a Git tag, the deploy workflow will:
- Package all skills
- Create a GitHub Release with `.skill` files attached

## GitHub Setup

### Required Secrets

Add to your repository's Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions:

| Secret | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Your Anthropic API key for skill uploads |

### Getting an API Key

1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)
2. Navigate to API Keys
3. Create a new key
4. Add it as a repository secret
