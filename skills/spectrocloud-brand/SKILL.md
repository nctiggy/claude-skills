# Spectro Cloud Brand Foundation (2025 Rebrand)

Single source of truth for Spectro Cloud visual identity, messaging, and design principles. Other skills (exec-doc-generator, slide-deck-generator, web UI, etc.) should READ this skill for brand details rather than maintaining their own copies.

## When to Use

- Building any customer-facing or internal document, presentation, or web UI
- Need to reference brand colors, logos, typography, or messaging
- Checking correct brand tone, terminology, or visual treatment
- Co-branding materials with customer colors alongside SC identity

## Brand Identity

### Mission

Spectro Cloud's mission is to help organizations simplify their IT infrastructure in order to unlock innovation at scale. Kubernetes is the critical enabler.

### Vision

Be the universal platform orchestrator for modern enterprise IT infrastructure: for every application, in every environment, from far edge to hyperscale cloud.

### Tagline

**"Simplicity that unlocks innovation at scale"**

Turning chaos and complexity into effortless control to help businesses realize their true potential.

### Company Overview

- Founded 2019 by CEO Tenry Fu, VP Engineering Gautam Joshi, CTO Saad Malik
- Series C (late 2024)
- Products: **Palette** (K8s management), **Palette VerteX** (gov/regulated), **PaletteAI**, **Palette VMO** (VM orchestrator)
- Position: mature technology scale-up, NOT a startup

## Design Principles

The 2025 rebrand is built around **the fold** -- inspired by origami:

1. **Simplicity and elegance** -- clean geometric shapes, neat layouts, open space
2. **Control and repeatability** -- tessellations, lattice patterns, repeating shapes (like Cluster Profiles)
3. **Choice, flexibility and versatility** -- origami metaphor: from a simple sheet of paper, endless variety through folding and layering; broad color palette
4. **Trusted platform** -- no cartoons, no off-the-shelf illustrations, no rough edges; platform front-and-center, not people

### The Fold

- Core brand expression: diagonal folded ribbons at **38.5 degrees** (matching the logo Strata mark)
- Color blocking with monochromatic shifts to mimic folding depth
- Crease patterns (thin lines, 0.5-2pt weight) inspired by origami unfolding
- Print patterns inspired by Japanese geometric patterns (evoke structure, consistency, "blueprint" metaphor)
- Do NOT use multiple folded ribbons on a single page ("confetti streamers" effect)
- Do NOT use heavy patterning directly behind text or logos

### Animation Principles (for web/motion)

- Clean, simple, crisp without being sharp
- Tactile, gentle, smooth -- NOT bouncy, playful, mechanical, or fluttery
- Folding/origami motifs with implied 3D through perspective (not drop shadows)
- Typography animation adds emphasis/clarity, never character-by-character
- Product UI demos: let the feature be the star, simplify surrounding elements

- Orange `#B94B01` and Lilac pass AA large only (~3.3:1)

## Logos

SVG logo files are in `assets/`. Key variants:

| File | Use |
|------|-----|
| `spectrocloud-logo-horizontal.svg` | Full-color for light backgrounds. Strata mark in brand teals, wordmark in `currentcolor` |
| `spectrocloud-logo-horizontal-knockout-white.svg` | All-white for dark backgrounds. Official knockout from Brand Drive |

### Logo Rules

- The symbol is called the **Strata** (inspired by origami, S-form, resembles Cluster Profile stack)
- Always use as part of horizontal or vertical logo (not standalone except for favicons/avatars)
- Horizontal logo is preferred; vertical only when horizontal space is limited
- Minimum size: 75px wide (horizontal), 36px wide (vertical)
- Clearspace: equal to the full height of the word "Spectro" on all sides
- Do NOT: recreate, recolor, rotate, distort, add effects, place on busy backgrounds, alter typeface

### Inline SVG Notes

- Wordmark paths use `currentcolor` -- set CSS `color` on the SVG element to control
- Footer usage: `color: var(--ink)` with `opacity: 0.6`
- Header (dark bg): use the knockout-white SVG (`fill="#fff"`)
- Always add `fill-rule="evenodd"` to prevent letter counter fill issues in Puppeteer/Chrome

## Messaging

READ `references/messaging.md` for full boilerplates, value props, customer quotes, and competitive positioning.

### Short Boilerplate

> Turn the chaos of Kubernetes into effortless control, whatever the shape of your business.
>
> Spectro Cloud delivers simplicity and control to organizations running Kubernetes at any scale. With its Palette platform, Spectro Cloud empowers businesses to deploy, manage, and scale Kubernetes clusters effortlessly -- from edge to data center to cloud -- while maintaining the freedom to build their perfect stack.

### Key Phrases

- "Simplicity that unlocks innovation at scale"
- "Turning chaos and complexity into effortless control"
- "For every application, in every environment, from far edge to hyperscale cloud"
- "Choice without the risk, control without complexity, scale without the overhead"

### Tone

- **Mature enterprise** -- we are a technology scale-up, not a startup
- **Platform-forward** -- put Palette/product front and center, not people
- **Real tech terms** -- don't shy away from Kubernetes, clusters, bare metal, edge
- **Pain-focused** -- reference pain points (complexity, drift, vendor lock-in) then benefits
- **No cartoons, no off-the-shelf illustrations** -- geometric shapes only
